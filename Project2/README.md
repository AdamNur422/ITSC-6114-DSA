# Project 2: Graph Algorithms and Related Data Structures


## Problem 1: Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm

This program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node to all the other nodes in the graph. When running the program it will ask you if you want to pick a directed or undirected graph, afterwards you can pick one of 3 graphs for each then it will ask you to pick a node from the graph (The input for the graph node isnt case sensitive and if you want to see how many nodes you can view the image or the txt file for the following graph). If you want to add a input file and a input image just add them to the respective directory and update the python code. Also make sure to format the txt file from given project (Apart from the last line because thats the source node).

## Problem 2: Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm



## Project Requirements

make sure to install the following packages

```bash
pip install pillow
```


Make sure that the project structure looks like this:
